# ResearchGate--SW2-Project

This repository is a part of course work for CS 251 Software Engineering-2 - FCAI-HU

The main idea is to create a website like researchgate.net that should enable  authors to create an account or login to their accounts and be able to upload their researches on the website. also be able to find other authors by searching for them and see the papers they uploaded. How ever papers can be written by more than one author, which means that if we opened a certain paper, then we can see the paper details plus the other participated authors, and we can click on any of these participated authors which will open their profiles. Finally authors can like or dislike other authorsâ€™ papers and write comments on it.

This Project Is Built With ASP.Net MVC Following Clean Code And Solid Princibles
